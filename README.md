# TV-Show-Vote-MapReduce

In this project, I utilized a .csv file containing the top-rated TV shows from the United States, Japan, and France. I implemented a MapReduce job using the Java programming language, and I executed the program through NYU’s Dataproc—a managed Hadoop and Spark service provided by New York University—utilizing HDFS for scalable and reliable processing of big data workloads in the cloud.

The results are organized as follows: “Country - Name of Show, Vote Count”
